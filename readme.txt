Project Description
Sushi Go is a card game where 2~5 players compete against AI. The game takes place over 3 rounds. To start a round, all players simultaneously choose any 1 card from their hands that they would like to keep. When each player has done this, everyone reveals their chosen cards.


After revealing cards, your remaining hand is passed to the player on your left. Everyone picks up their new hands and the next turn begins. You now have a new and smaller hand to choose from.Repeat the process until there are no cards left. Then, a score is counted based on the chosen cards. The final score is the sum of scores each round. The person with the highest score wins.


The detailed rules for the game are included in the help page of the game. You need both strategy and luck to win! Good luck:)
