Update:
Pillow needs to be installed in order to run the main.py
Here is the instruction:
For Windows:
Run this Python code block in your main Python file (it will print the commands you need to paste into your command prompt):
import sys
print(f'"{sys.executable}" -m pip install pillow')
print(f'"{sys.executable}" -m pip install requests')
Open Command Prompt as an administrator user (right click - run as administrator)
Copy-paste each of the two commands printed in step 1 into the command prompt you opened in step 2.
Close the command prompt and close Python.
Re-open Python, and you're set (hopefully)!

For Mac or Linux:
Run this Python code block in your main Python file (it will print the commands you need to paste into your command prompt):
import sys
print(f'sudo "{sys.executable}" -m pip install pillow')
print(f'sudo "{sys.executable}" -m pip install requests')
Open Terminal
Copy-paste each of the two commands printed in step 1 into the command prompt you opened in step 2.
If you see a lock and a password is requested, type in the same password that you use to log into your computer.
Close the terminal and close Python.
Re-open Python, and you're set (hopefully)!
